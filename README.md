## Introduction

**dessimozlab/nf-oma-browser-build** is a pipeline for building an [OMA Browser](https://omabrowser.org) instance from 
an OMA (*Orthologous MAtrix*) analysis. 
The pipeline converts the output of either a production OMA run or a [FastOMA](https://github.com/dessimozlab/FastOMA) 
run into the HDF5 files needed to run a omabrowser webserver. The pipeline
integrates a lot of additional data, i.e. GO annotations, domain annotations 
and cross-references to uniprot and refseq.

## Pipeline summary
TBD.
